# Addons Finale Edition
The 15th anniversary update of TankTrouble introduced a new weapon - the booby trap! Addons users experienced bugs as a result of the update, since the extension had not been updated. It was officially deprecated, meaning there would be no more future updates.  
This Finale Edition of Addons fixed the bugs and users can enjoy the gameplay without hindrance.

The Finale Edition also does not have the Changelog Popup or Addons Bulletin Board (on the news page).  
This is due to Addons being the Finale Edition, meaning there will not be any future updates.
